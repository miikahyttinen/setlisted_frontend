# Setlisted

Setlisted is a tool to view and save setlists. Front-end runs React in a browser and is served by REST Api back-end wirtten with Node.js. This is an excericse project for Full Stack Programming course at the University of Helsinki (CS Department).

## The problem 

My passion is to solve real world problems with programming. Setlisted solves a problem of a writing and storing setlists for a live music performance. It is very common to write setlists by hand (or at list by hand on a computer) and there is no state-of-the-art way of storing or sharing those. Making a setlist is a time-consuming problem. It can take an hour and you can easily make mistakes eg. forget the new songs you planned to play or get stuck in patterns like repeatedly playing the same songs in every performance. 

## Minimum viable product

The MVP should have following features: 



1. registration for new users
2. login as a user
3. creating a new setlist
4. viewing all setlists of a user
5. sharing setlists to everyone (in some way) as user

## Additional features

* Automated setlist creation
* Statistics of played songs
* Serving data of played songs between users
* Commenting 

## Tests 

I'm planning to do E2E tests using Cypress library.
